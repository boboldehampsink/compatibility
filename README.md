DEPRECATED - Compatibility plugin for Craft CMS
=================

Plugin that makes Craft's CMS work in older browsers

Features:
 - Adds a shim for HTML5 History API
 - Fixes CSS for older browsers
 
Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "compatibility"

Deprecated
=================

With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this tool has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.

Changelog
=================
### 1.0.2 ###
 - Fix for User Agent not always being available (for example via command line)

### 1.0.1 ###

### 1.0 ###
